# Bitcoin Tracking App

A very simple app that will display the current price of Bitcoin, and it's trend over the past 1 hour, 24 hours, or 7 days. Uses a very simple API provided by [Coinlore](https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api). 

Also - the application itself strictly follows the TDD architecture (Test Driven Development). [Resocoder's](https://resocoder.com/) tutorial was followed to the bone so there is a lot of striking similarities.

The project was aimed at improving my knowledge and experience under Flutter, especially while experimenting with different architectures that I'm not familiar with.
